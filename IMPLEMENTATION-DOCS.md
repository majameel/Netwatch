- **Comprehensive logging** with timestamps and color coding
- **Smart alert generation** based on individual thresholds
- **Performance history tracking** with visual charts

## üîß Storage Architecture

### localStorage Keys:
- `netpulse-targets` - Target configurations and runtime data
- `netpulse-monitoring-state` - Active monitoring sessions
- `netpulse-alerts` - Alert history with severity levels
- `netpulse-logs` - Real-time activity logs
- `netpulse-settings` - Global application settings

### State Recovery Process:
1. **Application Load** ‚Üí Load persisted settings, alerts, logs
2. **Fetch Targets** ‚Üí Retrieve from database + merge localStorage data
3. **Restore Monitoring** ‚Üí Automatically restart active monitoring sessions
4. **Real-time Sync** ‚Üí Continuously save state changes

   - Alert count badges in tab headers
   - Export functionality for alert data

3. **üìã Live Logs Tab**

   - Container timeout detection
   - Export functionality for log data

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Management

### Global Settings:
- Default latency threshold (150ms)
- Default packet loss threshold (10%)
- Alert sound notifications
- Gemini analysis integration
- Theme preferences

### Individual Target Settings:
- Ping interval (5s default, 1-300s range)
- Latency threshold (150ms default, 1-5000ms range)
- Packet loss threshold (10% default, 0-100% range)
- Alert enable/disable toggle

## üöÄ Real-time Monitoring

### Ping Execution:
- **Real ICMP packets** via Node.js ping library
- **Individual intervals** per target (no shared timers)
- **Automatic error handling** with container timeout detection
- **Performance tracking** with response time measurement

### Data Processing:
- **Live chart updates** with SVG-based visualizations
- **Rolling history** (last 100 ping results per target)
- **Smart alerting** based on consecutive failures and thresholds
- **Log aggregation** with 1000-entry limit per target

### Alert System:
- **High Latency Alerts** when response time exceeds threshold
- **Packet Loss Alerts** for connectivity issues
- **Offline Alerts** after 3 consecutive failures
- **Severity Levels** (Low, Medium, High, Critical)

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### Memory Management:
- **Interval cleanup** on component unmount
- **History limiting** (100 entries per target)
- **Log rotation** (1000 entries total)
- **State batching** to reduce localStorage writes

### Chart Rendering:
- **SVG-based charts** for lightweight performance
- **Data sampling** (last 20 points for charts)
- **Smooth animations** with CSS transitions
- **Responsive scaling** based on data range

### State Persistence:
- **Debounced saves** to localStorage
- **Error handling** for storage quota limits
- **Incremental updates** rather than full state dumps
- **Recovery mechanisms** for corrupted data

## üîÑ Monitoring Lifecycle

### Target Addition:
1. User enters name and address
2. API call to store in database
3. Automatic page refresh to sync state
4. New target appears with default settings

### Monitoring Activation:
1. User clicks "Start" button
2. Interval created with target's individual settings
3. Real-time ping execution begins
4. UI updates with live data and status changes

### Settings Updates:
1. User modifies target settings
2. Active monitoring stopped if running
3. Settings saved to localStorage
4. User prompted to restart with new settings

### Page Refresh Recovery:
1. All persisted state loaded from localStorage
2. Database targets merged with persisted data
3. Active monitoring sessions automatically restored
4. UI rebuilt with complete state

## üéØ Testing Recommendations

### Core Functionality:
- Add multiple targets with different settings
- Start monitoring and verify different intervals
- Refresh page and confirm monitoring resumes
- Modify settings and test restart prompts

### State Persistence:
- Generate alerts and logs, then refresh
- Verify all data persists across sessions
- Test with browser dev tools localStorage inspection
- Confirm no data loss during normal usage

### Performance Testing:
- Monitor 3+ targets simultaneously
- Run for extended periods (30+ minutes)
- Check for memory leaks in browser dev tools
- Verify UI responsiveness under load

## üìù Implementation Notes

- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent styling and responsive design

### Architecture Benefits:
- **Modular design** with clear separation of concerns
- **Scalable state management** supporting unlimited targets
- **Robust error handling** with graceful degradation
- **Professional UI/UX** matching modern dashboard standards
- **Real-time capabilities** with efficient update mechanisms
