# NetPulse Network Monitor - Project Status
*Last Updated: July 24, 2025*

## 🎯 Current Project State: PRODUCTION-READY

### ✅ Completed Features

#### Core Network Monitoring
- **Real ICMP Ping Implementation**: Uses Node.js ping library for actual network packets
- **HTTP 405 Error Resolution**: Fixed API endpoints with proper POST /api/ping
- **Database Integration**: SQLite database with complete CRUD operations
- **Target Management**: Add, delete, start/stop monitoring with persistence
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Configurable ping intervals with live updates

#### Enhanced User Interface
- **Individual Target Cards**: Redesigned UI with expandable details (matching user's image 3 requirements)
- **No-Scroll Layout**: Each target has dedicated expandable sections for Performance/Alerts/Logs
- **Professional Charts**: SVG-based performance visualization with latency/packet loss tracking
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for all operations
- **Responsive Design**: Professional dark theme with modern styling

#### Settings & Configuration
- **Persistent Settings**: localStorage-based configuration with automatic application
- **Ping Interval Control**: Real-time adjustment with monitoring restart
- **Threshold Management**: Configurable latency and packet loss thresholds
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback

#### Monitoring Features
- **State Persistence**: Monitoring continues across page refreshes
- **Alert System**: Real-time alerts for network failures and threshold violations
- **Live Logging**: Activity logs with export functionality
- **Performance Tracking**: Historical data with professional charts
- **Export Capabilities**: Data export for alerts and logs

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with Vite build system
- **Backend**: Node.js Express API with real ping functionality
- **Database**: SQLite with complete target management
- **Containerization**: Docker multi-container setup (frontend:3000, api:3001, monitor)

#### Key Files Modified
- `src/App.tsx`: Main dashboard with enhanced UI and monitoring logic
- `api/server.js`: Express API with real ICMP ping endpoint
- `nginx.conf`: Proxy configuration for container communication
- `test-ping.js`: Verification script confirming real network monitoring

#### Verification Status
- ✅ Real ICMP ping packets confirmed (not HTTP simulation)
- ✅ All API endpoints functional
- ✅ Database operations working
- ✅ Docker containers running successfully
- ✅ UI enhancements deployed

### 🚀 Latest Improvements (Session Completion)

#### Settings Management
- **Fixed Ping Interval Application**: Settings now apply immediately with proper monitoring restart
- **Enhanced saveSettings Function**: Includes setTimeout-based restart and detailed logging
- **Real-time Configuration**: Changes take effect without manual restart

#### Target Management
- **Improved Add Target**: Toast notifications, automatic refresh, comprehensive error handling
- **Auto-refresh Fallback**: If target addition appears to fail, automatic page refresh ensures persistence
- **Better User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages for all operations

#### UI Layout Redesign
- **Individual Target Cards**: Each target has dedicated expandable section
- **Show/Hide Details Toggle**: Per-target expansion without scrolling requirements
- **Tabbed Interface**: Performance/Alerts/Logs tabs within each target card
- **Individual Settings**: Target-specific configuration within expandable sections

### 🐛 Issues Resolved

1. **HTTP 405 Errors**: ✅ Fixed with proper API endpoint implementation
2. **Ping Interval Not Applying**: ✅ Fixed with enhanced settings restart logic
3. **Monitoring Stops on Refresh**: ✅ Fixed with localStorage persistence
4. **UI Scrolling Required**: ✅ Fixed with individual expandable target cards
5. **Target Addition Feedback**: ✅ Fixed with enhanced error handling and auto-refresh
